# User Management Dashboard (Frontend)


This repository contains the frontend for the MERN coding challenge — React + TypeScript + Redux + Formik + Yup.


## Setup
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start json-server (backend mock): `npm run server` (runs on port 4000)
3. Start app: `npm start`


## Notes
- API base is `http://localhost:4000` (see src/api/axios.ts)
- The frontend expects the json-server endpoints described in the challenge.
- This scaffold implements list, create, edit, view, delete, pagination, filters and form validation.
